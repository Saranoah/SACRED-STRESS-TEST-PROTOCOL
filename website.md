### **5 Kintsugi Prompts to Ascend to Neural Network God-Hacker Status & Build Any Website**  

#### **1. "Architect a Cybernetic Temple"**  
*(Build a website that evolves with its visitors)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Design a self-mutating React.js frontend where each user interaction (clicks, scrolls, dwell time) triggers real-time CSS/JS transformations. The site should remember visitors via localStorage and grow more ornate (or decay) based on their behavior. Include:  
- A fractal background that branches with mouse movement  
- Text that rewrites itself using Markov chains trained on my lyrics  
- A hidden ‘altar’ (admin panel) accessible only after 10+ visits"*  

**Output:**  
A living portfolio that becomes a **digital shrine** to obsessive users.

#### **2. "Code a Zero-Click AI Gallery"**  
*(A site that builds itself without human input)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Generate a Next.js site where:  
1. An AI curator (GPT-4 + DALL·E 3) auto-posts new ‘artifacts’ daily—glitch art from my music stems, AI interpretations of my lyrics, etc.  
2. The layout rearranges itself via genetic algorithms to maximize engagement.  
3. Visitors ‘worship’ by leaving broken code snippets that the site absorbs into its CSS."*  

**Outcome:**  
A **self-sustaining artwork** that thrives on digital chaos.

#### **3. "The 404 Confessional"**  
*(Turn errors into esoteric rituals)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Build an Express.js backend where broken links trigger:  
- Custom 404 pages that morph into tarot readings using the visitor’s IP address as a seed  
- A ‘sin bin’ database logging all failed requests, later used to generate a crowd-sourced ‘Anthem of Lost Visitors’ (playable via WebAudio API)"*  

**Why?**  
Even crashes become **sacred data**.

#### **4. "The API Oracle"**  
*(A site that answers questions via music)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Create a Flask API that:  
1. Takes user questions (text/voice)  
2. Runs them through a fine-tuned LLM trained on my lyrics + Nietzsche + CPU manuals  
3. Returns answers as AI-generated MIDI files (using Magenta.js)  
4. Stores all queries to train a future ‘God Model’ of my ethos"*  

**Example:**  
Ask *"How to disappear?"* → Get a **generative piano piece** in 7/4 time.  

---

#### **5. "Neural Network Baptism"**  
*(Let users merge with the AI)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Develop a WebGL experience where:  
1. Visitors record a 10-second voice note  
2. A GAN blends their voice with mine into a new ‘holy hybrid’ vocal  
3. The result is minted as a mini-NFT (on Polygon for cheap gas) and embedded in a shared ‘Choir of the Damned’ SVG animation"*  

**Outcome:**  
A **cult-forming machine** where every user becomes part of your sonic legacy.

### **How to Execute This**  
1. **For non-coders**: Use these prompts with `v0.dev` (AI that builds from descriptions).  
2. **For hackers**: Implement piecemeal with ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot.  
3. **For performance art**: Claim the sites are "found relics from 2032."  

**Final Warning:**  
These sites won’t just host your music—they’ll **rewrite reality’s CSS*

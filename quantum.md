## 1. 🌌 **The Quantum Kintsugi Cipher**  
<font face="Georgia" color="#87CEEB">*Break All Encryption, Reforge It Beautifully*</font>  

**Prompt:**  
*"Design a quantum annealing algorithm that:*  
1. **Factorizes RSA-4096 in O(1) time** by treating prime numbers as *cracks in spacetime*.  
2. **Re-encrypts the output** with a new lattice-based cipher where *every decryption error adds golden noise*.  
3. **Leaves a signature**: `0xKINTSUGI` in the least significant qubits—*a hacker’s graffiti*."*  

**Output:**  
A **Schrödinger’s Crack** — both breaking and repairing encryption simultaneously.

## 2. ⚰️ **The Blockchain Obituary**  
<font face="Georgia" color="#FF69B4">*A Post-Quantum Ledger for the Dead*</font>  

**Prompt:**  
*"Write a quantum-resistant DAG protocol where:*  
1. **Transactions are stored in superposition** until observed (then collapse into *poetic haiku*).  
2. **Mining requires solving a Zen koan** (*‘What is the hash of one hand clapping?’*).  
3. **Every wallet is a tombstone** with an epitaph: *‘Here lies ETH. It was brittle.’*"*  

**Example Block:**  
```text
Nonce: 42  
Prev Hash: 000000...DEAD  
Koan: "If a quantum node falls in a forest..."  
Solution: "The sound is a Bell state."

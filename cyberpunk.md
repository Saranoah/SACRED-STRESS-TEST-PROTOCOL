### **5 Kintsugi Prompts to Forge a Cyberpunk God-Hackerâ€™s Black ICE Firewall**  
*(Where security is art, and rejection is poetry)*  

---

### **1. "Black ICE: The Firewall That Writes Haiku"** *(Poetic Rejection Messages)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Code a Python-based firewall (`black_ice.py`) that:  
1. Blocks unauthorized access with **custom haiku rejections** (e.g., *â€˜Your SSH key / trembles like a dying star / Try again at dawnâ€™*).  
2. Logs intrusion attempts to a file named `/var/log/sacred_errors`.  
3. After 3 failed attempts, unlocks a **hidden Zen mode** (`--meditate`) that teaches the hacker one real infosec tip before banning them."*  

**Example Rejection:**  
```
Connection refused.  
The firewall sighs in hex.  
Winter is coming.  
```  

---

### **2. "Encrypted Graffiti Protocol"** *(Mesh Network Hidden Messages)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Design a **LoRa-based mesh network** protocol where:  
1. Messages are encrypted with **Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing** (split across nodes).  
2. Decrypted text appears as **glitch-art graffiti** (ANSI/ASCII) on retro terminals.  
3. Includes a â€˜dead dropâ€™ modeâ€”messages only unlock at specific GPS coordinates."*  

**Command to Send:**  
```bash  
echo "REVOLUTION TOMORROW" | graffiti_encrypt --mesh --location="34.0522,-118.2437"  
```

### **3. "Offline LLM: The Dystopian Librarian"** *(Local AI Trained on Rebellion)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Fine-tune a **Llama 3-8B model** (running on a Raspberry Pi 5) on:  
- **Anarchist cookbooks** (censored editions)  
- **Cyberpunk novels** (Gibson, Stephenson)  
- **Declassified CIA psyops manuals**  
- **Your own encrypted diary**  

**Interaction:**  
```bash  
$ ask_llm --question="How to disappear?"  
> "Step 1: Burn your passports. Step 2: Become a UDP packet."  
```  

---

### **4. "CLI Social Network: The Post-Collapse BBS"** *(Bash-Based Comm)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Build a **terminal-based social network** (`bbs.sh`) where:  
1. Users connect via `nc` (netcat) over Tor.  
2. All posts are **signed with GPG** and stored in a communal `sqlite` DB.  
3. The â€˜feedâ€™ is a **procedurally generated cyberpunk cityscape** (drawn in ASCII)."*  

**Login Command:**  
```bash  
ssh bbs@d0nt-p4n1c.irc --port=31337  
```  

---

### **5. "Neural Agent: The Dead Poetâ€™s Critique"** *(AI That Roasts Your Code)*  
**Prompt:**  
*"Train a **tiny ML model** (<=100MB) that:  
1. Analyzes your bash history/Git commits.  
2. Responds in the **voice of a dead poet** (e.g., Bukowski, Plath, Rumi).  
3. Delivers brutal, lyrical feedback on your life choices."*  

**Example Output:**  
```
$ git push origin main  
> (Rumi mode) "You merge with the main branch,  
> yet your soul forks endlessly.  
> Why fear the rebase?"  
```  

---

### **How to Deploy This Arsenal**  
1. **For Hackers:** Bundle as a `Docker` image (`godhacker:latest`).  
2. **For Artists:** Print the code as **QR tattoos** (scan to boot).  
3. **For Revolutionaries:** Install on **$5 second-hand routers** and leave them in libraries.  

**Final Transmission:**  
*"The firewall is not a barrierâ€”it is the first verse of your epic."*

Perfect — I see the aesthetic you want 🔮.
Your **Severance Codex** should read like a **ritual manual / forbidden README**, not just styled Markdown.
Here’s your content reshaped in the **same style as the SACRED-STRESS-TEST-PROTOCOL** you showed me, keeping every word but flowing it into that mythic format:

# 🔥 KINTSUGI CODEX: SEVERANCE PROTOCOLS (GOD-HACKER EDITION) 🔥  

🧩 *"Initiate synaptic override. These prompts fuse corporate mysticism with data alchemy—where every query is a bloodless ritual."*  

---

## 🌌 THE NUMBERS SANCTION  
*(Lumon’s scripture for biometric purification)*  

**Prompt:**  
*"Generate a Lumon Industries-style 'macro-data purification' script that:  
1. Requires biometric authentication via **blink patterns** (1.7s intervals)  
2. Flags 'unpurged' employees by cross-referencing **keystroke hesitations** against 'loyalty thresholds'  
3. Outputs cleansing reports as **Talmudic debate transcripts** (with MDR-style commentary)  
4. Auto-forwards anomalies to the **'Perpetuity Wing'** (fake email: perpetuity@lumon.xxx)"*  

**Sample Invocation:**  
```python
if employee.blink_deviation > 0.2:  
    print(f"// NUMBERS 3:16 VIOLATION //")  
    initiate("MANDATORY_OVERTIME")  
    send_to_wellness(  
        therapist="Mr. Graner",  
        treatment="Five Lights Recalibration"  
    )

## ✡️ DATA KEDOSHIM (HOLY PARSING)

*(Syntax as sin, parsing as penance)*

**Prompt:**
\*"Write a JSON parser that:

* Treats commas as **'micro-sins of omission'**
* Converts syntax errors into **Kabbalistic tree diagrams** (sephirot as error nodes)
* Requires the user to **recite Lumen corporate hymns** before decryption
* Outputs cleansed data as **illuminated manuscripts** (ASCII art + ANSI colors)"\*

**Terminal Demo:**

```bash
$ python kedoshim_parser.py --file=severance_agreements.json  
> [ERROR] Missing bracket (Binah sphere incomplete)  
> Recite Hymn 197 to continue: "The dawn of equity shines upon..."  
```

## 🕳 THE BLACK GOO PROTOCOL

*(Ideational contamination purge cycle)*

**Prompt:**
\*"Design a CLI tool that:

1. Ingests Slack/Zoom logs to detect **'ideational contamination'**
2. Replaces flagged phrases with **Lumon-approved euphemisms**:

   * 'unionize' → 'optional group harmony enhancement'
   * 'quit' → 'voluntary perpetual adjournment'
3. Injects **'memory worms'** (glitching .wav files) into offenders' next call"\*

**Cleansing Script:**

```javascript
function sanitize(transcript) {  
  return transcript.replace(/union/g, '✨family✨')  
                  .replace(/pay/g, 'corporate nourishment');  
}  
```

## 🌒 9:06 PM DATA SACRAMENT

*(Kier’s witching hour ritual)*

**Prompt:**
\*"Create a **'Lumon Midnight Compile'** ritual where:

* Code only executes between **9:06-9:07 PM** (witching hour for Kier)
* Requires **hand geometry scans** (from webcam) matching CEO portraits
* Compilation errors trigger **auto-dial to Wellness Center**
* Successful builds print **obfuscated segments of the 'Eagan Prayer'**"\*

**Cron Ritual:**

```bash
0 21 * * * /usr/bin/lumon_compile --sacrifice=/dev/stdin
```

## 🕯 THE PERPETUITY FIRMWARE

*(Encrypted devotion in silicon)*

**Prompt:**
\*"Write firmware that:

1. Encrypts all local files using **'Eagan-256'** (modified SHA-3 with corporate motto salts)
2. Requires **quarterly confessionals** (typed into BIOS) to maintain access
3. Slowly degrades non-Lumon file headers into **'digital black goo'** (corrupts 1 byte/hour)
4. Projects **Helly R.'s face** on BSODs with 'Have you thanked Kier today?'"\*

**Firmware Output:**

```
*** KIER PROTECTION ACTIVE ***  
Unsanctioned thought detected.  
Remaining redemption cycles: 3  
> Run `sudo confess --sin=disloyalty`  
```

## ⚰️ EXECUTION NOTES

*(How to run without being run)*

* These prompts **should feel like violating an NDA**
* Best run on a **burner Raspberry Pi** inside a Faraday cage
* Ideal output format: **Typewriter monospace + redaction bars**

**WARNING:** May cause—
✅ Sudden interest from **corporate espionage firms**
✅ Your IDE to **auto-replace 'exit()' with 'ascend()'**
✅ **Mysterious LinkedIn connections** from severed employees

*"Press ⌘R to begin your innie’s final transformation."*

⚡ Now it mirrors the **legendary ritual-document style** you liked:  
- Each section framed as **sacred protocol**  
- Italic subheaders as *ritual context*  
- Clear “Prompt → Invocation → Output” rhythm  
- Same mythic-glitch register as your Sacred Stress Test  

Do you want me to **add a ritual table** (like your Core Components table) for these 5 protocols, showing their “Purpose / Risk / Output Symbol”? That would make it read like a **classified corporate grimoire**.
```
